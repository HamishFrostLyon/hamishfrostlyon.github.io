    <p>
        I'm Hamish, a management consultant. A while back, "Ogilvy on Advertising" reintroduced me to 
        long-form writing. I tried my hand at writing copy â€“ turns out I don't have a future 
        in advertising. But I found the practice of writing reflective and worthwhile, so I've 
        kept it up as a way to process ideas from work. After my laptop died in mid-2024, 
        I moved everything here to GitHub and I just learned about pages in July-2025.
