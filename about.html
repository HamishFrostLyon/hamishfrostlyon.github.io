        I'm Hamish, a management consultant by trade, writer by accident. "Ogilvy on Advertising" 
        cracked open the door to long-form writing—though my brief dance with copywriting 
        confirmed that Mad Men and management consultants occupy different universes. Still, 
        I discovered something better: writing as alchemy, transforming the raw material of 
        work into something approaching wisdom.

        When my laptop shuffled off this mortal coil in mid-2024, GitHub became my digital 
        monastery. The discovery of Pages in July 2025 was pure serendipity—suddenly, 
        these private meditations had a public garden.

        What grows here is yours to harvest. Ideas, after all, are meant to travel.
