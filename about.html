    <p>
        I'm Hamish, a management consultant. A while back, "Ogilvy on Advertising" reintroduced me to 
        long-form writing. I found the practice of writing reflective and worthwhile, so I've 
        kept it up as a way to process ideas from work. After my laptop died in mid-2025, 
        I thought backing everything up on GitHub was a good idea, and then I discovered Pages.

        I'm experimenting with an editorial pipeline inspired by CI/CD practices â€“ automating 
        quality checks and cross-references between pieces. I'm also building an Obsidian-style 
        backlink system to create a knowledge graph of interconnected ideas. Please excuse any 
        editorial quirks while I refine these systems.
