  <p>
    I'm Hamish, a management consultant. A while back, "Ogilvy on Advertising"
    reintroduced me to long-form writing. I found the practice of writing
    reflective and worthwhile, so I've kept it up as a way to process ideas from
    work. After my laptop died in mid-2025, I thought backing everything up on
    GitHub was a good idea, and then I discovered Pages.

    I'm experimenting with an editorial pipeline inspired by CI/CD practices –
    automating quality checks and cross-references between pieces. I'm also
    building a Zettelkasten-style system to create a knowledge graph of
    interconnected ideas. The underlying philosophy is simple: do good works,
    and work conquers all. Please excuse any editorial quirks while I refine
    these systems.
