    I'm Hamish, a management consultant who works on strategy and operations. When my computer died mid-2025 I moved to GitHub. The title 'Do Good Works' refers to actions that are considered morally righteous and beneficial - which is what I think we should all aspire to. Originally I wanted to call my website "steady work overcame all things" (by Virgil) who eloquently understood that patience and a methodical approach creates momentum.
